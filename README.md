### Hi there 👋, my name is Dylan! I study physics at Syracuse University. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a foundation in graduate-level physics to use towards future theoretical research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how lattices are implemented in QCD and Quantum Gravity research simulations. 
- 💬 Ask me about astronomy and quantum computing! I have experience as a Teaching Assistant in both of these topics.
